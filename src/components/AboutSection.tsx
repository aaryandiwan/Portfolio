      <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
        I’m a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at Galgotias University with a deep passion 
        for Data Analytics and AI/ML. My work focuses on building intelligent, data-driven solutions—from 
        real-time fraud detection systems to predictive maintenance models.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
        I consider myself a continuous learner and a dedicated listener. Whether I’m cracking a complex SQL 
        query for car sales data or decoding a new AI trend, I approach every challenge with focus and discipline.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
        When I’m not coding or diving into datasets, you’ll likely find me playing sports or enjoying a good cup 
        of coffee. I believe the discipline of an athlete and the precision of an analyst go hand in hand.
